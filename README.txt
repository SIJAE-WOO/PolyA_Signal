# PolyA_Signal

1. This prediction was done with DeepPASTA (Steffen et al., 2005) to perform a genome-wide polyA site prediction for human based on the PolyA-Seq data in (Derti et al., 2012). The original prediction was conducted in hg19 coordinates and liftovered to hg38 (12-04-2022). 
2. APADB polyA site file was downloaded in APADB webpage (http://tools.genxpro.net:9000/apadb/download/).
